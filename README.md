# Kuhn-CFR
 
Requires: Matplotlib, Tabulate

Kuhn-CFR is a solver for the imperfect imformation game of Kuhn Poker. 
The program uses a counterfactual regret minimization algorithm built in Python, which calculates the regret of each action, based on its wins and losses, eventually leading to the program making the most theorectically optimal decisions in each position after millions of iterations
